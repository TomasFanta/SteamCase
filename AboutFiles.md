# SteamCase

Here I am going to introduce you to files and what they do.

First one main.py is scraper. Which means that it crawls the specified url and based on filters implemented using the python library BeautifulSoup saves raw data based on those filters.

The next file is currency_Swap.py. This file deals with the preparation of data in order to have everything ready for file #3 Analysis.py. 

The purpose of the final Analysis.py file is to obtain clarifying information about this project goal based on linear regression.
