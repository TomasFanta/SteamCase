# SteamCase
Hello and Welcome in the SteamCase repository.

This repository is all about virtual items (more precisely, cases/containers) in a videogame known as Counter Strike Global Offensive/Counter Strike 2.

The aim of this project was to obtain raw data on existing crates/containers from the platform where these items are traded and to establish correlations between variables, as well as to gain insight into how and why the prices of said crates actually fluctuate in said platform.
